# Airline Ticket Sales Database & Passenger Age Analysis (PostgreSQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the **design and implementation of a relational database** in **PostgreSQL** to model airline ticket sales and passenger demographics.  

The primary goal was to analyze whether **passenger age influences travel class selection**, such as younger passengers preferring economy and older passengers leaning toward business class.  

The database was created **from scratch**, covering schema design, data insertion, and SQL-based analysis to generate actionable insights for business decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a fully functional **relational database** in PostgreSQL.
- Model real-world **business processes** such as ticket sales and customer demographics.
- Perform **SQL queries and analysis** to uncover trends between **age groups** and **travel class choices**.
- Demonstrate how structured databases can support **business intelligence and decision-making**.

---

## 🗂️ Database Design
- **Entities & Tables:**
  - `Passengers` – passenger demographic details (e.g., age).
  - `Sales` – ticket purchase information including travel class.  

- **Key Features:**
  - Proper schema design with **primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints**.
  - Normalized tables for efficient data storage.
  - Queries to join and analyze sales with passenger demographics.

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Age distribution of passengers across travel classes.
- Correlation between **age groups** and **travel class preference**.
- Insights into business strategies (e.g., targeting promotions for specific age groups).
